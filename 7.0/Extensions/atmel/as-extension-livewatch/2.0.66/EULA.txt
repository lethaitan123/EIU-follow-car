12.	Governing Law; Dispute Resolution. This Agreement is to be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of California (as permitted by Section 1646.5 of the California Civil Code or any similar successor provision), without giving effect to any choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the internal laws of the State of California to the rights and duties of the parties. This Agreement will not be governed by the U.N. Convention on the Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. Except for actions for injunctive or other equitable relief, which may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the California state courts in Santa Clara County, California, or if there is exclusive federal jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and the Parties hereby consent to, and agree to submit to, the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

13.	General. Licensee will not, and will have no right to, assign, delegate or otherwise transfer (whether voluntarily, by operation of law or otherwise) this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder to any third party without the prior written consent of Atmel, and any purported assignment, delegation or other transfer without such consent will have no force or effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No failure of either party to enforce any right under this Agreement will be deemed a waiver of such right or any other right under this Agreement. Any waiver by a party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party hereunder will not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of such provision or a waiver of any breach of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be superseded, modified, or amended except in a writing signed by an officer of each party. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the extent possible consistent with the intent of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. This Agreement will be fairly interpreted in accordance with its terms and without any strict construction against either party because it was drafted by such party or for any other reason. This Agreement will constitute the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and expressly supersedes and replaces all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, quotations, negotiations and communications, written or oral, between the parties relating to such subject matter.
